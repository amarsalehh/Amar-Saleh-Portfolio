I will be reviewing the code, reasoning, and outcomes of a linear regression problem from a class lab assignment I completed.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Libraries required for analysis are loaded here
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(rpart)
library(rsample)
library(caret)
library(mgcv)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)



# Run this code chunk without altering it
# clear the session
rm(list=ls())

# Data is stored in a csv file, the first row contains the variable names. 
# we call our data mydata
mydata<-read.csv ("Data_RLab5.csv", header=TRUE)

# remove lowbirthweight
mydata<-mydata%>%
  select(-lowbirthweight)







# Please provide your code for Task 1 in this code chunk


# Examine variable descriptions and structure of the dataset
str(mydata)

# Check for factor/categorical variables
factor_vars <- sapply(mydata, is.factor)

# Check for missing values in the dataset
missing_vals <- colSums(is.na(mydata))


# Handling missing values for numeric variables
numeric_cols <- names(mydata)[sapply(mydata, is.numeric)]
for (col in numeric_cols) {
  if (sum(is.na(mydata[[col]])) > 0) {  # Check if column has missing values
    mydata[[col]][is.na(mydata[[col]])] <- median(mydata[[col]], na.rm = TRUE)
}
}

# Handling missing values for categorical variables
factor_cols <- names(mydata)[sapply(mydata, is.factor)]
for (col in factor_cols) {
  if (sum(is.na(mydata[[col]])) > 0) {  # Check if column has missing values
    mode_val <- names(sort(table(mydata[[col]]), decreasing = TRUE))[1]
    mydata[[col]][is.na(mydata[[col]])] <- mode_val
  }
}



# Correlation analysis for numeric variables
numeric_data <- mydata[, sapply(mydata, is.numeric)]
correlation <- cor(numeric_data)

# Chosen target variable
target_variable <- "weight"

# Find variable with the highest correlation (in absolute value) with the target variable
cor_with_target <- correlation[target_variable, ]
cor_with_target <- cor_with_target[order(abs(cor_with_target), decreasing = TRUE)]
highest_corr_var <- names(cor_with_target)[2]  # Variable with the highest correlation (excluding 'weight')


# Create a scatter plot with a linear regression line
ggplot(mydata, aes_string(x = highest_corr_var, y = target_variable)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE, color = 'red') +  # Add linear regression line
  labs(x = highest_corr_var, y = target_variable, title = paste("Scatter Plot of", target_variable, "vs", highest_corr_var))

```

Here is a rundown of my process:

-   In this lab assignment I started off by loading all the libraries I would need.

-   I then inputted a code to read the data on hand before getting rid of the lowbirthweight.

-   After, I ensured that all numeric and factor variables were properly coded as so.

-   I went on to recognize any absent values and used a code to utilize median amounts in place of absent numeric variables and mode amounts in place of absent categorical variables.

-   Then, I had to decide which of the variables had the greatest connection, keeping absolute value in mind, to our target variable. To better display this interaction between the variables, I made use of a scatterplot and included a linear regression line.

    What does the outcome mean?

-   The scatterplot and linear regression line showcased that with the variables, weeks and weight, there appears to be a positive correlation between the two. To sum it up, as the weeks in which the pregnancy lasted increased, the baby's weight in pounds when delivered also increased.
