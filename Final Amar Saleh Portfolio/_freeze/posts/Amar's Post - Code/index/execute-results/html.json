To better display this interaction between the variables, I made use of a scatterplot and included a linear regression line.\n\n    What does the outcome mean?\n\n-   The scatterplot and linear regression line showcased that with the variables, weeks and weight, there appears to be a positive correlation between the two. To sum it up, as the weeks in which the pregnancy lasted increased, the baby's weight in pounds when delivered also increased.\n",
