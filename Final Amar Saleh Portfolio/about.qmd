Hello everyone! My name is Amar Saleh and I am working towards completing an Advanced Data Analytics MS from UNT. My undergraduate years were spent at UTA where I graduated with a Finance BBA in 2021. My love for analyzing numbers is what inspired me to pursue a finance degree. Upon graduation I became more fascinated with the technology field and was motivated to find a way to intertwine my love for analytics with the tech world- data analytics was my answer! I work as an auditor for a cable company where I help ensure all data collected about the boxes is correct along with confirming all necessary boxes are accounted for.

Experience in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, RStudio, Python, Linux, SAS
